  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>
    Louis Thayer Hills was an American artist who produced staggering numbers of
    paintings, drawings, and prints beginning as a young man in the 1950s and
    continuing until his passing in 2019 at the age of 83.
  </p>

  <p>
    Born December 30, 1935, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Louis grew up in a Mormon
    family in the post-war years. After early studies at the University of Utah,
    he moved to Chicago, where he worked in the picture gallery department at
    Marshall Field’s restoring and framing artwork—an experience that deeply
    influenced his artistic path.
  </p>

  <p>
    Louis later settled in southeastern Wisconsin with his wife Kay Ann
    Plutchak, where they raised their family and restored a farmhouse that
    became both home and creative retreat. While working professionally at
    J.I. Case, Louis traveled internationally and continued creating art
    relentlessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    After retiring in 1993, his artistic output intensified dramatically,
    resulting in decades of prolific creation across media. Even in the final
    years of his life, as his health declined, Louis continued to make art
    daily—work that remained colorful, imaginative, and deeply human.
  </p>

  <p>
    Louis passed away peacefully on June 26, 2019, leaving behind a vast body
    of work and a lasting artistic legacy.
