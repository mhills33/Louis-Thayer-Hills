  <h2>About the Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The collection encompasses decades of work across a broad range of media,
    subjects, and scales. Due to the scope of the estate, this offering includes
    both intimate works on paper and larger statement pieces suitable for
    residential, commercial, and hospitality settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pricing has been structured to reflect the size and breadth of the collection,
    with the intention of making original works accessible while respecting the
    artist’s lifetime of production.

  <h2>Public Exhibition &amp; Sale</h2>
  <p>
    The public memorial exhibition and sale will provide visitors the opportunity
    to view and acquire original works by Louis Thayer Hills in person. Selected
    works will be available for purchase throughout the exhibition period.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dates, location, and additional details will be announced prior to the opening.

  <h2>Trade &amp; Bulk Viewing</h2>
  <p>
    Due to the scale of the collection, a dedicated viewing period will be offered
    for <strong>restaurants, hotels, interior designers, and other commercial
    buyers</strong> interested in acquiring multiple works.
  </p>
  <p>
    This trade preview allows buyers to select cohesive groupings of original
    artworks and explore a wide range of sizes and styles well suited for larger
    spaces. Works are available directly from the artist’s estate, with pricing
    structured to support volume acquisitions.

  <h2>Pricing &amp; Acquisition</h2>
  <p>
    Original works will be offered at accessible price points reflecting the size
    and scope of the estate. The goal of this sale is to place the work into active
    display — in homes, collections, and public-facing spaces — rather than storage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both individual collectors and buyers seeking multiple works are welcome.
